# EquationsApp

As a scientist I want an easy way to manage my equations and speed up the solving process if possible.

The Idea is to create an app where you can input values into various equations and get the output you are after.

There will be 3 parts to this app: 

1. "Quick Mode" Input output into equations that are shown (Blackbox)
2. "Learning Mode" Show equations and explanation and allow input and output in equations (White Box)
3. "Test Mode" 2 boxes and a question for input and output of an equation (Jet Blackbox)
